# acm-cert

Just an ACM certificate.

## Description

Deploys an ACM certificate as a Serverless Application Repository application. The idea is just to make it slightly easier to deploy a certificate to us-east-1 for use with CloudFront where the rest of your app is deployed to a different region.

## Getting started

acm-cert is available via the AWS Serverless Application Repository: https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/home?region=eu-west-2#/published-applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-2:211125310871:applications~acm-cert
